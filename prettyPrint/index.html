            lovers of scientific thought. They are enterprising and ambitious.
            They have the ability to plan. They dislike being guided by others ,
            are intense when interested, vehement when excited. They are rather
            stubborn, but often frank. Quick tempered, they resent imposition
            and are liable to go to extremes. Their constitution will be hot.
            They love beauty, art and elegance. They have practical ideas. If
            Aries is afflicted they suffer from diseases pertaining to the head.
            Mental affliction and derangement are also likely if Saturn and the
            Moon are in Aries.
